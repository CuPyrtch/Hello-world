# Hello, world!

The purpose of this challenge is to use Git and Github to create and submit a trivial Python program.

Use the following procedure for submitting all of your programs:

1. Create your Github account.
2. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository to your own account (don't
  worry about cloning anything -- yet.)
3. **Replace** the section of the comment that says ```<your name here>``` with your name.
4. **Replace** the section of the comment that says ```<list sources used, if any>``` with a list
  of any sources or people that provided assistance in your work. Replace with ```none``` if necessary.
5. Test your code by pasting the Github URL of **your** 
  ```helloworld.py``` file in to the URL window at [runpython.org](https://runpython.org),
  then press ```load``` and ```>``` (it shouldn't do anything yet).
6. Press the ```login``` button at runpython.org go connect with Github. You can now edit your version
  of ```helloworld.py```. Add your code at the bottom of the file (after the ```#``` comments). 
  Press ```commit``` to save/commit your edits to Github. Verify that your
  version of ```helloworld.py``` on Github is being updated correctly.
7. Issue a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to submit your code.
8. Your code will be subjected to a rudimentary automatic test and will be accepted or rejected. If your
  pull request fails (shows a big **red x**), click on the ```details``` link to see a log of the test
  that failed. In particular, check for messages near the *very end of the log* to understand what exactly
  failed.
9. Continue to edit your code from [runpython.org](https://runpython.org). Every time you commit a change
  the new code will be tested again.
10. To see the status of your pull request from your Github account, visit the ```Pull requests``` link at
  the top of the Github page.


## Assignment 

Write and submit a Python program that prints the following (Note: your program must produce
output that matches **exactly**!):

```
Hello, world!
```
